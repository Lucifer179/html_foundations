# HTML vs CSS vs Javascript
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is what contains all the information in a webpage. All the text, links, buttons. 

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what gives _style_ to those elements. It positions them, gives them colour, changes font, etc. 

**Note:** CSS is mainly used to create _static_ visual effects.

- Javascript brings in interactivity in a webpage. It allows you to change HTML and CSS elements to match your specifications.
