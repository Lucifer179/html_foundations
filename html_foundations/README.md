# HTML vs CSS vs Javascript
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is what contains all the information in a webpage. All the text, links, buttons. Hypertext means text that can link to other things like different parts in the same page.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what gives _style_ to those elements. It positions them, gives them colour, changes font, etc. 

**Note:** CSS is mainly used to create _static_ visual effects.

- Javascript brings in interactivity in a webpage. It allows you to change HTML and CSS elements to match your specifications.

# Elements and Tags
Most elements are wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags. For example, a paragraph is enclosed in `<p>` `</p>` tags. So, the three parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the actual content inside it and the closing tag. 

Some elements that don't have closing tags are called **Void Elements**. Examples include `<br>` and `<img>`. They're void elements because they don't have any content inside them.
